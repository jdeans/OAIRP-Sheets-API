# OAIRP-Sheets-API

This repository was made to store files relating to accessing the Google Sheets API via Python. The project was created as part of a Spring 2017 presentation to OAIRP. 

There are two scripts in the repository, both demonstrate the same thing. One of the scripts uses the native Google API modules. The other uses a module called gspread that makes the process significantly easier.
